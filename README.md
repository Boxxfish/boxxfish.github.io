# Hello!

My name's Ben Giacalone, and I'm a CS student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (BS/MS, Spring 2024). I've worked primarily with machine learning (PyTorch), web (Vue, Svelte, Django) and gamedev (Godot, Bevy), but I'm always open to learning new stuff. In particular, I have a strong interest in using reinforcement learning to create intelligent systems. 

Here are some things I've done, some of which are WIPs. Check them out!

## Projects

### Apps and Demos

- [DQN Demo](https://cs.rit.edu/~bsg8294/dqn-demo) - A Deep Q Network demo created for an RIT AI talk.
- [Visualizing ColBERT Queries](https://cs.rit.edu/~bsg8294/colbert/query_viz.html) - Visualizes ColBERT embeddings and shows what they match to. Created as part of my Master's thesis.

### Mini Research Projects

- [SmashRL](https://github.com/Boxxfish/smash-rl) - Training a neural network to play Super Smash Bros. Melee, with retrieval.
- [PaintRL](https://github.com/Boxxfish/paint-rl) - Using RL for stroke-based artistic rendering.
- [Nano](https://github.com/Boxxfish/nano) - Controlling lots of tiny things with neural networks.

### Tools and Libraries

- [RL Template](https://github.com/Boxxfish/rl-template) - A standard template I use for RL projects.
- [ViewGD](https://github.com/Boxxfish/viewgd) - A Vue-like reactivity framework for Godot 4.
