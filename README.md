# Hello!

My name's Ben Giacalone, and I'm a CS student at the Rochester Institute of Technology (BS/MS, Spring 2024). I've worked primarily with machine learning (PyTorch), web (Vue, Svelte, Django) and gamedev (Godot, Bevy), but I'm always open to learning new stuff. In particular, I have a strong interest in using reinforcement learning to create intelligent systems. 

Here are some things I've done, some of which are WIPs. Check them out!
